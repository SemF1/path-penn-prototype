# Path@Penn Prototype

This is a small HTML/CSS project I made for my HCI class.  
It’s a mockup of the **opening screen** for a redesigned Path@Penn mobile course registration system.

## What’s here
- `index.html` → the main page  
- `style.css` → styling for the page  
- `images/` → logo or other assets (if added)

## How to view
1. Download the repo or clone it.  
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser.  
3. To see it in a phone view:
   - Open Chrome  
   - Right click → **Inspect**  
   - Click the device toolbar (phone/tablet icon)  
   - Choose a device

## Notes
- This is just a static prototype — buttons don’t do anything.  
- Built with basic HTML/CSS, no frameworks.  
- Colors and layout are meant to look like my high-fidelity design.
